<img src="./assets/icon-superpeer.png" alt="Superpeer logo" width="128" height="128">

The Superpeer Toolkit for Alfred makes it easy to quickly access Superpeer's web features, including calls, discount codes, and more, using the `superpeer` keyword.

You will need to have a Superpeer account to benefit from this workflow, since nearly all shortcuts require authentication.
