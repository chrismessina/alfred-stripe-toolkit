The Stripe Toolkit for Alfred makes it easy to quickly access Stripe's dashboard features, including payments, invoices, and customers, and more with the `stripe` keyword.

You can also create new payments, subscriptions, and products with the `new` keyword.

You will need to be signed in to your Stripe account in your default web browser to benefit from this workflow.
